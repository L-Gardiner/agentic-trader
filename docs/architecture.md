# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Agentic Trader platform is built using a domain-driven design approach, with clear separation of concerns and modular components. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and extensible.

### Key Components

1. **API Layer (`/api`)**
   - FastAPI-based REST API
   - Route handlers for each domain
   - Request/response validation using Pydantic
   - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

2. **Domain Layer (`/domains`)**
   - Backtesting: Strategy simulation and evaluation
   - Execution: Order management and trading platform integration
   - ML Pipeline: Model training, evaluation, and registry
   - Sentiment: Market sentiment analysis
   - Agents: Autonomous trading agents
   - Strategies: Trading strategy implementations

3. **Infrastructure Layer (`/infrastructure`)**
   - AWS-based cloud infrastructure managed with Terraform
   - Containerized services with Docker
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - Database and cache services

4. **Frontend Layer**
   - Streamlit dashboard for data visualization and basic controls
   - React+TypeScript web application for advanced trading interface

### Data Flow

1. Market data ingestion through various adapters
2. Data processing and feature engineering
3. Strategy evaluation and signal generation
4. Order execution through trading platform adapters
5. Performance monitoring and reporting

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, asyncio
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Streamlit
